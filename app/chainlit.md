# Notion Assistant

Hi! This is an app to help you work smarter with your notion content and maybe learn some Chainlit along the way!

## How it Works

Make sure you have setup your API tokens for Notion, Chainlit, & OpenAI, setup access to your Notion page(s), and run the compile_docs.py script.

This process pulls information from your notion, builds text files from the content, and saves it in a vector database so the Notion Assistant can search for answers from the documents.

Simply start by typing a question below!
